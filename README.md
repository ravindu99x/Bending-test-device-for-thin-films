# Bending-test-device-for-thin-films
This project is designed to interface with a KEITHLEY Meter, enabling the automation of reading measurements while allowing users to input parameters such as "Bending Speed" and "Number of Bends." All meter readings are recorded and saved in a CSV file, with each reading corresponding to the specified number of bends.

Connect both the ArduinoUNO and KETHLEY Meter and run the program.
